            <p>Artcore is a recently inspired genre of music that combines drum and bass 
                with classical instruments
                like piano and violin. Artcore branches from Japanese indie music. 
                With a small following, its influence and spread has been in a niche circles, 
                but its reach goes further than just Japan. <br/>
